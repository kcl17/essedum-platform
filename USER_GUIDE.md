# User Guide: Creating AI Applications with Essedum

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use the Essedum framework to create, train, and deploy AI-powered applications.

## 1. Create a Data Container

The first step is to create a data container where all the data required for your application will be stored. Essedum uses Minio for this purpose.

For a detailed walkthrough, watch the video below:

## 2. Create and Connect an Execution Container

Next, you need to set up an execution container where your Python code for training, inference, or RAG will be executed. This step also covers how to connect the execution container to the data container you created in the previous step.

For a detailed walkthrough, watch the video below:

## 3. Upload Data to the Data Container

Before you can build your application, you need to upload the required data to the data container. Ensure your data is in the correct format and accessible to the user.

For a detailed walkthrough, watch the video below:

## 4. Create and Run a Training Pipeline

A training pipeline is a specialized AI application focused on training a model using the available data. In the video below, we demonstrate how to create a classification machine learning algorithm.

For a detailed walkthrough, watch the video below:

## 5. Create and Run an Inference Application (with UI)

Once you have a trained model, you can use it to create an inference application. This application can include a user interface for easy interaction.

For a detailed walkthrough, watch the video below:

## 6. Example: RAG Application

This framework can also be used to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. The following videos demonstrate how to create a RAG data ingestion pipeline and a complete RAG application with a user interface.
